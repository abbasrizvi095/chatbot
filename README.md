## AI-assisted PR Reviews

This repository demonstrates automated PR reviews using:

The AI posts PR summaries and review guidance.
Final review and approval always remains with engineers.


This project is a Streamlit-based chatbot that first tries to answer questions using a predefined FAQ knowledge base. If a suitable FAQ match is found, the answer is displayed instantly. If the user is not satisfied with the FAQ answer, they can click a button to ask the AI (LLaMA 3.1) for a more detailed or conversational response.

The app uses Ollama for local AI inference, ensuring fast, private, and cost-free responses without relying on external APIs.

🚀 Features
📄 FAQ First Approach – Instantly answers from a predefined FAQ dataset using semantic search.

🤖 Ask AI if Not Satisfied – Allows the user to get a custom LLaMA 3.1 AI answer if the FAQ is insufficient.

💾 Chat History – Keeps the full conversation context for AI to refer back to previous messages.

🔍 Intelligent Matching – Uses vector similarity search to find the most relevant FAQ.

💡 Local AI Inference – Powered by Ollama and LLaMA 3.1 for privacy and speed.

🎨 Clean UI – Built with Streamlit for a simple, interactive interface.

🖱 Enter Key or Button – Ask questions by pressing Enter or clicking "Ask".
